Day 1 

Easy: 
The cricket World Cup has started in Chefland. There are many teams participating in the group stage matches. Any team that scores 
12
12 or more points in the group stage matches qualifies for the next stage.

You know the score that a particular team has scored in the group stage matches. Determine if the team has qualified for the next stage or not.

Medium:
Easy Pronunciation
Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "schtschurowskia", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.

We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains 
4 or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is easy to pronounce. For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.

You are given a string S consisting of N lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above â€” print YES if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.

For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters 
{a,e,i,o,u} and the consonants are the other 21 characters.

Hard:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
