Repository created for "45 days of code challenge", year 2024

Day 1 

Easy: 
The cricket World Cup has started in Chefland. There are many teams participating in the group stage matches. Any team that scores 
12
12 or more points in the group stage matches qualifies for the next stage.

You know the score that a particular team has scored in the group stage matches. Determine if the team has qualified for the next stage or not.

Medium:
Easy Pronunciation
Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "schtschurowskia", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.

We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains 
4 or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is easy to pronounce. For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.

You are given a string S consisting of N lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above â€” print YES if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.

For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters 
{a,e,i,o,u} and the consonants are the other 21 characters.

Hard:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Day2:

Subscriptions
A new TV streaming service was recently started in Chefland called the Chef-TV.
A group of N friends in Chefland want to buy Chef-TV subscriptions. We know that 6 people can share one Chef-TV subscription.
Also, the cost of one Chef-TV subscription is X rupees. Determine the minimum total cost that the group of N friends will incur so that everyone
in the group is able to use Chef-TV.

TCS Examination
Two friends, Dragon and Sloth, are writing a computer science examination series. There are three subjects in this series: 
DSA,TOC, and DM. Each subject carries 100 marks.
You know the individual scores of both Dragon and Sloth in all 3 subjects. You have to determine who got a better rank.
The rank is decided as follows:
The person with a bigger total score gets a better rank
If the total scores are tied, the person who scored higher in DSA gets a better rank
If the total score and the DSA score are tied, the person who scored higher in TOC gets a better rank
If everything is tied, they get the same rank.

Remove Duplicates From a sorted Array
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially.
The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
